SQL queries of the US Wildfires dataset available on Kaggle

The database queried is available for free on Kaggle.com, posted by Rachael Tatman, and is titled "1.88 Million US Wildfires: 24 years of geo-referenced wildfire records."  

I created visualizations on Tableau, based on some of the .sql files attached.  
These visualizations can be found on my Tableau profile page at the following link:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.raymond.bristow/viz/wildfires_16240570218070/Dashboard1.
